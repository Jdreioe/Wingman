# Wingmate

Wingmate is an FOSS project that lets people who cannot speak, get an actually great voice via Azure Neural Voices.

Wingman is currently developed by me, Jonas Drei√∏e, who has CP and used to have a Rolltalk, then a GridPad, then a Tobii i-13 speech device. The current Tobii Windows PC cost ~50k DKK (for touch only), has a 7. gen intel processor, is so slow and has a program UI that feels like it was from Vista-era. GridPad was constantly crashing due to their program being 32-bit (in 2023) and was super slow, but felt more modern in its UX (more like Windows 7). Rolltalk stopped development in 2020, had a XP-era UI and was super buggy. So, in September of 2024, I decided to make my own AAC-program. I wanted to make it open source, so we can develop a better user-experience

Since it's now using Flutter, the app is able to be built cross platform.
