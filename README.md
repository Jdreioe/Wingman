# Wingman
Wingman is an FOSS project that lets people who cannot speak, get an actually great voice via Azure Neural Voices.

Wingman is currently developed by me, Jonas Drei√∏e, who has CP and used to have a Rolltalk, then a GridPad, then a Tobii i-13 speech device.
The current Tobii Windows PC cost ~50k (for touch only), has a _7. gen intel processor_, is _so slow_ and has a program UI that feels like it was from Vista-era.
GridPad was constantly crashing due to their program being 32-bit (**in 2023**) and was super slow, but felt more modern in its UX (more like Windows 7).
Rolltalk stopped development in 2020, had a XP-era UI and was super buggy. So, in September of 2024, I decided to make my own AAC-program.
I wanted to make it open source, so we can develop a better user-experience

Currently, I have plans for Windows, Linux, Android versions. I don't have a Mac - otherwise I would be developing for iPad as well in the future.
